## Course Description

This course provides ап overview of the field of Artificial lntelligence (AI) and how to write computer programs that use AI. Students will learn what AI is, how machine learning works and how to write programs using AI libraries, models and techniques. There will bе а focus оп generative AI and LLMs (Large Language Models) and how to write programs that use LLMs. The risks and dangers and ethical issues related to AI will bе explored along with its potential benefits.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Explain what AI programming is.
2. Discuss the potential dangers and benefits of AI to society.

3. Write programs that use symbolic AI techniques.

4. Write programs that use statistical AI techniques.

5. Write programs that uses neural networks for image recognition.

6. Write programs that use LLMs (Large Language Models).

7. Create a custom chatbot using a fine-tuned LLM.



### Online Resources

#### Course Materials

There is no textbook for this class. In place of a textbook you will read online tutorials and other free online resources.

 [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com), is a free high-quality course that I reccomend, although it won't be directly used in this course. The course is mainly for non-programmers, but does a good job of covering many concepts relevant to this course.

#### Learning Management System

Moodle is the Learning Management System (LMS) used for this course; LCC’s Moodle site is at: [classes.lanecc.edu](https://classes.lanecc.edu). 

### Software

All of the software required for this class is free.  You can use any operating system: Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. 

#### Software Required for Course Work

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CS210-CourseMaterials/CS210_GettingStartedGuide.html) for a list of the software needed for this class.

You will need to download and install any software you don't already have on your computer. The software has

already been installed on the computers in the classroom and in the CIT computer lab.


####  Free and Discounted Software for Students

None of the software provided in these offers is required for this class, but you may want to take advantage of the free and discounted software offers.

- [**Azure Dev Tools for Teaching**](https://signup.azure.com/studentverification?offerType=3) (previously known as Microsoft Imagine Premium, Dream Spark, and MSDNAA) is a subscription-based offering, paid for by the LCC CIT department, providing access to professional development and design tools, software, and services from Microsoft. 
- [**Microsoft Office 365**](https://help.lanecc.edu/TDClient/389/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=5328) LCC students and staff can get a free subscription to Office 365, which includes Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and more.
- **[On The Hub](https://lanecc.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_mnuMain=f189368a-f0a6-e811-8109-000d3af41938)** has partnered with Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, Symantec, VMware and other software publishers to offer discounted and free software for students and faculty.



### Computer Lab and Tutoring

#### CIT Computer Lab and In-Person Tutoring

The CIT Main lab (Building 19, room 135) is equipped with computers and software which are available exclusively for students in the CIT department. There are tutors available in the lab to help you with your lab work. The schedule for when the lab will be open and when in-person tutors are available is TBD.

#### Online Tutoring

See the [LCC Tutoring Services](https://www.lanecc.edu/tutor) web page for information.



## Assessment and Grading

### Points for Each Graded Activity

The table below summarizes the possible points for each assessment task as well as the course as a whole:

<sup>*</sup> The code review and reading quiz with the lowest grade will be dropped from the grade calculation.

### Grade Scale

Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:                  

|       | **+**     |          | **-**    |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| **A** | 100 to 98 | 97 to 92 | 91 to 90 |
| **B** | 89 to 88  | 87 to 82 | 81 to 80 |
| **C** | 79 to 78  | 77 to 72 | 71 to 70 |
| **D** | 69 to 68  | 67 to 62 | 61 to 60 |
| **F** | Below 60  |          |          |

### Quizzes

Weekly (except midterm an final quiz weeks) quizzes are given that cover learning material for that week. These quizzes are "open book".

### Participation and Attendance

While participation and attendance are essential to succeed in this class, they will not be graded.

#### No Show Drop

The college’s “no show, drop” policy requires that: during the first week students must complete at least one activity (a quiz or assignment) otherwise the student will be dropped from the class.

### Midterm and Final Quizzes

The midterm and final quizzes are given in weeks 4 and 8. See Moodle for exact dates and times. Quizzes are "closed book", but students may prepare a 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of notes to refer to during the quiz. These quizzes may be taken either:

- On-campus students (hybrid modality) will take the quiz In the classroom during the normal class time.
- online students will take the quiz In the Instructional Testing Center in the Center Building, room 311. See the [Instructional Testing Services](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/instructional-testing-services) web site for testing times and procedures.  

Students who live outside the Eugene/Springfield area can send an email to [online@lanecc.edu](mailto:online@lanecc.edu) well in advance of the test dates to arrange for your midterm and final to be proctored at a location near you.

### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss assignments and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words you can help each other, but you can’t copy any part of someone else’s work. The end product must be each student’s own individual work.

### Use of AI

Generative AI tools such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT are useful resources and you are encouraged to use them, but don't use them to give you quiz answers or do your assignments for you. Use them to help you learn, to come up with ideas, or for drafts of text you write.

### Late Work

- Grades for assignments submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%.
- No late assignments accepted after Tuesday of week 11, finals week.
- Quizzes and exams cannot be taken after the due date. 
  Plan ahead! Exceptions will only be made for illness or emergency situations.
