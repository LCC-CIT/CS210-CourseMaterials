## Course Description

This course provides ап overview of the field of Artificial lntelligence (AI) and how to write computer programs that use AI. Students will learn what AI is, how machine learning works and how to write programs using AI libraries, models and techniques. There will Ье а focus оп generative AI and LLMs (Large Language Models) and how to write programs that use LLMs. The risks and dangers and ethical issues related to AI will Ье explored along with its potential benefits.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Explain what AI programming is.

| **Course Total**          |        |                          | **1000**  |

### Grade Scale

Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:                  

|       | **+**     |          | **-**    |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| **A** | 100 to 98 | 97 to 92 | 91 to 90 |
| **B** | 89 to 88  | 87 to 82 | 81 to 80 |
| **C** | 79 to 78  | 77 to 72 | 71 to 70 |
| **D** | 69 to 68  | 67 to 62 | 61 to 60 |
| **F** | Below 60  |          |          |

### Quizzes

Weekly (except midterm an final quiz weeks) quizzes are given that cover learning material for that week. These quizzes are "open book".

### Participation

Participation is assessed differently depending on whether you are taking the class online, on Zoom or in person.

- In person and on Zoom (synchronous): Your grade is based on class attendance and participation in class discussions.
- Online (asynchronous): You grade is based on participation in the Moodle forums and on Discord.

### Team Projects

You will work together with your team to either make a presentation or create an AI solution. Each team member will have a specific part to contribute and will be individually graded.

### Midterm and Final Quizzes

The midterm and final quizzes are given in weeks 4 and 8. See Moodle for exact dates and times. Quizzes are "closed book", but students may prepare a 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of notes to refer to during the quiz. These quizzes may be taken either:

- On-campus students (hybrid modality) will take the quiz In the classroom during the normal class time.
- online students will take the quiz In the Instructional Testing Center in the Center Building, room 311. See the [Instructional Testing Services](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/instructional-testing-services) web site for testing times and procedures.  

Students who live outside the Eugene/Springfield area can send an email to [online@lanecc.edu](mailto:online@lanecc.edu) well in advance of the test dates to arrange for your midterm and final to be proctored at a location near you.

### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss assignments and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words you can help each other, but you can’t copy any part of someone else’s work. The end product must be each student’s own individual work.

### Use of AI

Generative AI tools such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT are useful resources and you are encouraged to use them, but don't use them to give you quiz answers or do your assignments for you. Use them to help you learn, to come up with ideas, or for drafts of text you write.

## Attendance

See the participation and attendance section under [Assessment and Grading](#Assessment and Grading) for grading criteria.

### No Show Drop

The college’s “no show, drop” policy requires that: during the first week students must complete at least one activity (a quiz or assignment) otherwise the student will be dropped from the class.

### Late Work

- Grades for assignments submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%.
- No late assignments accepted after Tuesday of week 11, finals week.
- Quizzes and exams cannot be taken after the due date. 
  Plan ahead! Exceptions will only be made for illness or emergency situations.
