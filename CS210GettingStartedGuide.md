<h1>CS 123: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h1>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

[TOC]

# Introduction

Welcome to this class! 

Since the release of ChatGPT in November of 2022, AI has become an even hotter topic than ever. AI already had a big presence in our lives, but now it seems to have exploded in a way that has taken many of us by surprise.

AI has great potential for good as well as... well, evil. Some people are excited to see it advance, others are cautious and others see it as a doomsday technology. Regardless of your viewpoint, AI will play a big role in our future, so it is important to have some understanding of how it works and how we can use it for good while guarding against ways in which it might be abused.
