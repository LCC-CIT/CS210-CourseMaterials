Note

**Doctest Mode**

The code-examples in the above tutorials are written in a *python-console* format. If you wish to easily execute these examples in **IPython**, use:

```
%doctest_mode
```

in the IPython-console. You can then simply copy and paste the examples directly into IPython without having to worry about removing the **>>>** manually.
