## Implementing Rule-Based Systems

This technique described here is one of the fundamental symbolic AI approaches. It is essentially a search through a knowledge base of rules.

### Concept: forward chaining

Start with a set of *facts* (initial state) and then repeatedly apply *production rules* (If X, Then Y) to derive new facts. The "search" is for the applicable rules that move the system toward a goal. This is called *Forward Chaining* or *data-driven reasoning*.

### Simple Implementation Algorithm

This can be modeled using simple *lists* (for facts) and a collection of *if/then functions* or a large series of `if-elif` statements (for rules).

- Example Problem: A simple diagnostic system.
- Initial Facts: `['has_fever', 'has_cough']`
- Rules:
  1. IF `has_fever` AND `has_cough`, THEN `suspect_flu`.
  2. IF `suspect_flu` AND `has_headache`, THEN `recommend_rest`.
- The "Search": A main loop repeatedly scans the list of rules. If a rule's "IF" condition is met by the current facts, its "THEN" action (adding a new fact) is executed. The loop stops when the goal fact (e.g., `recommend_rest`) is added.

#### How *Forward Chaining* is Executed in the Algorithm

Forward chaining ( also called *data-driven reasoning*) is an *inference mechanism* where reasoning starts with the known data (facts) and continually applies rules to infer new conclusions (new facts) until a goal is reached.

In the algorithm you provided, this process is implemented by the following two core elements:

##### Fact-Driven Search

The main loop repeatedly scans the list of rules which constitutes the *forward chain*. The system looks at the available facts and tries to see what rules can be *triggered* by those facts.

##### Iterative Inference

- Rule Application: "If a rule's 'IF' condition is met by the current facts, its 'THEN' action (adding a new fact) is executed." This is the moment of *inference*—a new piece of knowledge is added to the system's working memory.
- Chain Continuation: Since a newly added fact might satisfy the condition of a different, unapplied rule, the loop continues to scan the rules list. This *chain* of deductions (Fact A → Fact B → Fact C...) is the "chaining" part of the process.

The process stops because the loop condition is satisfied. The loop condition is based on the *goal fact*, `recommend_rest`, so the chain has successfully completed when this is reached.

### Implementation

headache,nausea,suspect_migraine,

                    print(f"  [APPLY] Rule: {rule['if']} -> {new_fact}")

        # If a goal fact was added in this iteration, we could stop here, 
        # but we let it run one more time to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

[^1]: **A) Architectural Separation:** Rule-based systems established fundamental AI architecture by separating the  *Knowledge Base* from the *inference engine*, allowing rules to be easily modified without changing the program code.  **B) Formal Knowledge Representation:** They pioneered the structured representation of human logic making expert thought machine-readable for the first time. **C) Automated Reasoning:** The introduction of the *Inference Engine* provided computational *models* for deductive reasoning (like Forward and Backward Chaining), demonstrating how a computer could link discrete facts and rules to reach logical, non-obvious conclusions.
