## Announcements for Fall 2025

- **Week 8 is the last week to drop a class or change grade options**
  This <u>Friday, November 21</u> is the last day to make fall term schedule changes. This includes adding or dropping a course, withdrawing, taking an incomplete, or changing grading methods. 
  **Note**: Students should <u>always</u> consult [an academic advisor](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/academic-advising) and/or [financial aid](https://www.lanecc.edu/costs-admission/paying-college/financial-aid) representative before making these changes, especially withdrawing. These types of changes can potentially have implications for academic progress and/or financial aid awards. 

- **LCC Team Gets First Place at QuackHacks!**

  LCC took a six member team to the QuackHacks Hackathon this weekend, where they worked on a game together for 24 hours straight. They used Miro to brainstorm, Jira to manage the project, GitHub to coordinate their efforts, the Godot game engine with GDScript to build the game and Libresprite to build the game assets.

  <u>They earned first place in the Game Dev track!</u>

  You can see their work and description of themselves and their process here.

  If you see these students this week, let them know how proud we are!

## Q and A

- Do you have any questions about:

  - Lab 5&mdash;AI assisted programming?
  - The reading on the chat completion API?

  - Anything else?

## Assignments Due

### Week 8 *Chat Completion API*

**Topic: calling *chat completion* APIs**

- Tuesday 11/18   
  - Quiz 6 (GenAI) closes.
  - Lab 5  (AI Coding) beta version.
  - <u>Term project proposal.</u>  
    Submit a project proposal before starting on your app.
- Thursday 11/20
  - Lab 5 code review.
- Sunday 11/23
  - Lab 5, production version.
  - Quiz 7 over calling chat completion APIs.
  - Lab 6 (AI APIs) beta version

## Week 9: *Model Context Protocol* (MCP)

The *Model Context Protocol* (MCP) standardizes communication with and between LLMs to enable  *agentic AI*, allowing an LLM to move beyond simple chat and interact with apps and APIs. It lets developers write applications where AI can do things like  "go look up the user's latest file and then send an email". An MCP server takes care of translating those requests into system actions.

**Note**: 11/27 is Thanksgiving, the college will be closed Thursday and Friday.

## Week 10:  Your Term Project

Your project can be an entirely new app that incorporates some type of AI, or you can enhance one of your lab projects with an additional or different AI feature than it originally had. The project should be a stand-alone app console apps (not a Jupyter notebook).
