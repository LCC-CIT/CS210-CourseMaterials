# Python Coding Style Cheat-Sheet

This cheat-sheet for Python coding conventions is based on the PEP 8 official style guide.

## Line Length and Indentation

- Indentation: Use 4 consecutive spaces per indentation level and Prefer spaces over tabs.   

- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. 
- For comments and docstrings, limit lines to 72 characters. 
- Use implied line continuation within parentheses, brackets, and braces for wrapping long lines. 

## Naming Conventions

- **Modules:** Short, all lowercase names, with underscores if needed (e.g., `my_module.py`). 
- **Packages:** Short, all lowercase names, no underscores (e.g., `my_package`). 
- **Classes:** CapWords (CamelCase) convention (e.g., `MyClass`). 
- **Functions and Variables:** lowercase with words separated by underscores (snake_case) (e.g., `my_function`, `my_variable`). 
- **Method Arguments:** `self` for instance methods, `cls` for class methods. 
- **Constants:** ALL_CAPS with words separated by underscores (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`). 
- **Non-public Methods and Instance Variables:** Use a single leading underscore (e.g., `_my_private_method`, `_private_variable`). 
- **Name Mangling:** Use two leading underscores for truly "private" attributes, though this is  less common and often discouraged in favor of single underscore  convention (e.g., `__private_attribute`). 

## Comments  

- Limit line length to 72 characters. 
- Use complete sentences, starting with a capital letter. 
- Update comments when code changes. 
- **Block Comments:** Indent to the same level as the code they describe. Start each line with `#` followed by a single space. Separate paragraphs with a line containing only `#`. 

- **Inline Comments:** Use sparingly. Write on the same line as the statement, separated by two or more spaces. Start with `#` and a single space. Avoid explaining the obvious. 

## Whitespace

- **Binary Operators:** 

Always surround binary operators (assignment, comparison, arithmetic, etc.) with a single space on either side (e.g., `a = b + c`). 

- **Function Arguments:** 

No space between function name and opening parenthesis. No space immediately inside parentheses, brackets, or braces. 

- **Trailing Commas:** 

- Use trailing commas when defining tuples or lists on multiple lines for easier diffs. 

## Docstrings

- Use triple double quotes for docstrings (e.g., `"""This is a docstring."""`). 
- For one-line docstrings, keep them on a single line. 
- For multi-line docstrings, the opening and closing quotes should be on  separate lines, with the summary line and detailed explanation in  between. 

## Imports

- Place imports at the top of the file, after any module docstrings and `__future__` imports. 
- Import modules on separate lines (e.g., `import os\nimport sys`). 
- Order imports: standard library, third-party, local application-specific. Separate groups with a blank line. 
- Use absolute imports (e.g., `import package.module`) unless explicitly using relative imports within a package. 

## Blank Lines

- Use two blank lines to separate top-level function and class definitions. 
- Use one blank line to separate method definitions within a class. 
- Use blank lines sparingly within functions to indicate logical sections.
