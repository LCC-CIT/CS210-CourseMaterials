## What is TensorFlow?

From Wikipedia:

> TensorFlow is a [software library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) for [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). It can be used across a range of tasks, but is used mainly for [training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks#Training) and [inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference) of [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)).It is one of the most popular [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) frameworks, alongside others such as [PyTorch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch). It is [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License_2.0).
>
> It was developed by the [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain) team for [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google)'s internal use in research and production. The initial version was released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License_2.0) in 2015. Google released an updated version, TensorFlow 2.0, in September 2019.
>
> TensorFlow can be used in a wide variety of programming languages, including [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), and [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), facilitating its use in a range of applications in many sectors.
