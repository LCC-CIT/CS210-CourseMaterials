## This Week's Learning Objectives

This week you will review or get introduced to Python and learn about GOFAI (Good Old Fashioned AI) aka "classical" AI. 

The goals for this week are to:

- Adapt what you already know about programming to Python.
- Understand what "classical AI" is.
- Write a simple Python program that uses an AI algorithm.

## Announcements
