---



## Non-Classification Nearest Centroid Projects

Absolutely — while Nearest Centroid is primarily known as a classification tool, its underlying mechanism (computing and comparing centroids) can be repurposed for several **non-classification** tasks. Here are some creative and semi-realistic applications that stretch its utility:

---

### 🧭 1. **Prototype-Based Recommendation Systems**
- **Use Case**: Recommend items (e.g. movies, books, products) by comparing a user’s feature vector to genre or category centroids.
- **Why it works**: Instead of classifying, you're measuring proximity to “typical” preferences.
- **Example**: A music app could suggest songs closest to the centroid of your listening history.

---

### 🗺️ 2. **Geospatial Anchoring**
- **Use Case**: In mapping or logistics, compute the centroid of delivery zones or user clusters to optimize hub placement.
- **Why it works**: Centroids represent average location, useful for routing or resource allocation.
- **Example**: A food delivery service could dynamically adjust dispatch centers based on centroid shifts.

---

### 🧪 3. **Anomaly Detection**
- **Use Case**: Flag data points that are unusually far from their class centroid.
- **Why it works**: Distance from centroid can serve as a proxy for “normality.”
- **Example**: In network security, detect unusual user behavior by comparing to behavioral centroids.

---

### 🎨 4. **Style Transfer or Matching**
- **Use Case**: Match user-generated content (e.g. images, text, music) to the closest stylistic centroid.
- **Why it works**: Centroids can represent archetypal styles or moods.
- **Example**: A writing assistant could suggest edits to make a paragraph more “academic” or “casual” by nudging it toward a style centroid.

---

### 🧠 5. **Conceptual Mapping in Knowledge Graphs**
- **Use Case**: Use centroids to represent thematic clusters in embeddings (e.g. topics in documents, concepts in ontologies).
- **Why it works**: Centroids can anchor abstract regions in vector space.
- **Example**: In an AI taxonomy tool, you could visualize how paradigms cluster and evolve over time.

---

### 🧮 6. **Dimensionality Reduction Heuristics**
- **Use Case**: Use centroids to guide feature selection or interpret clusters in reduced space.
- **Why it works**: Centroids can highlight dominant directions or separations.
- **Example**: In PCA or t-SNE visualizations, overlay centroids to interpret latent structure.

## Nearest Centroid for Games

Yes — and it’s a surprisingly clever idea, Brian. While Nearest Centroid isn’t typically used for game AI, it can absolutely be adapted for **decision-making heuristics** in simple games, especially when you can represent game states or player behaviors as feature vectors. Here are a few semi-realistic and fun applications:

---

### 🎲 1. **Dice Game Strategy Selector**
- **Game**: Think of something like *Yahtzee* or *Farkle*, where players choose whether to reroll or bank points.
- **Approach**: Encode game states (e.g. current score, dice values, risk level) as feature vectors.
- **Use of Centroid**: Train on past games labeled with “bank” or “reroll” decisions. The AI picks the action whose centroid is closest to the current state.
- **Bonus**: You could visualize how “greedy” vs. “cautious” strategies cluster in feature space.

---

### 🃏 2. **Card Game Opponent Modeling**
- **Game**: Something like *War*, *Uno*, or *Blackjack*.
- **Approach**: Represent player behavior (e.g. frequency of drawing, discarding, bluffing) as vectors.
- **Use of Centroid**: Classify opponents into behavioral archetypes (e.g. aggressive, conservative) and adapt strategy accordingly.
- **Twist**: Let the AI evolve its centroid estimates over time as it observes more rounds.

---

### 🧠 3. **Simplified Poker Decision Engine**
- **Game**: A stripped-down version of *Texas Hold’em*.
- **Approach**: Encode hand strength, pot odds, and betting history as features.
- **Use of Centroid**: Train on labeled decisions (fold, call, raise) and use nearest centroid to choose action.
- **Why it works**: It’s fast, interpretable, and surprisingly effective in low-complexity scenarios.

---

### 🧩 4. **Turn-Based Game State Evaluation**
- **Game**: Any grid-based or turn-based game (e.g. *Tic-Tac-Toe*, *Connect Four*).
- **Approach**: Represent board states as vectors (e.g. piece positions, threat levels).
- **Use of Centroid**: Classify states as “winning,” “losing,” or “neutral” based on historical outcomes.
- **Twist**: Use centroid distances to guide move selection toward favorable outcomes.

---

### 🧪 Why It’s Viable
- Centroid-based models are **fast**, **interpretable**, and **low-memory**, making them ideal for embedded or casual game AI.
- You can even use **online updates** to shift centroids as the game progresses, giving a rudimentary form of learning.

---

## Nearest Centroid for Stock Market Applications

You’re thinking creatively again, Brian — and yes, a Nearest Centroid model *can* be adapted for stock-related tasks, though with some caveats. It’s not ideal for **price prediction**, which is inherently a regression and time-series problem, but it can be surprisingly useful for **stock recommendation** and **behavioral clustering**. Here's how:

---

## 📈 Use Case 1: **Stock Recommendation via Behavioral Centroids**
### Concept:
Group stocks into behavioral clusters (e.g. growth, value, momentum) based on features like:
- Volatility
- P/E ratio
- Historical return profiles
- Sector performance
- ESG scores (if you're feeling ethically inclined)

Then, compute centroids for each cluster. A user’s portfolio or preference vector (e.g. risk tolerance, sector bias) can be matched to the nearest centroid to recommend similar stocks.

### Why It Works:
- Fast and interpretable
- Doesn’t require forecasting
- Can be updated incrementally

---

## 📊 Use Case 2: **Market Regime Classification**
### Concept:
Classify current market conditions (e.g. bull, bear, sideways) based on macro indicators:
- VIX, interest rates, inflation
- Sector rotation patterns
- Momentum indicators

Nearest Centroid can assign the current feature vector to the closest regime centroid, which then informs strategy (e.g. defensive vs. aggressive stock picks).

---

## 🚨 Use Case 3: **Anomaly Detection in Stock Behavior**
### Concept:
Track a stock’s recent behavior vector (e.g. volume spikes, price movement, sentiment) and compare it to its historical centroid.
- Large deviations could signal unusual activity or potential breakout.

---

## ⚠️ Why It’s *Not* Ideal for Price Prediction
- Stock prices are continuous and noisy — better suited to regression models (e.g. LSTM, ARIMA, XGBoost).
- Nearest Centroid assumes static class centroids, which doesn’t capture temporal dynamics or autocorrelation.

That said, you could discretize price movements (e.g. “up,” “down,” “flat”) and use it as a classifier — but it’s a blunt tool compared to more nuanced models.

---



## Weather Prediction

Weather prediction is a fascinating domain, Brian — and while Nearest Centroid isn’t a go-to model for forecasting continuous variables like temperature or precipitation, it *can* be adapted for certain tasks within meteorology, especially when you frame the problem as **classification** rather than regression. Here’s how it could be used meaningfully:

---

## 🌦️ 1. **Weather Condition Classification**
### Use Case:
Predict categorical weather states (e.g. sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy) based on atmospheric features:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Pressure
- Cloud cover

### Why It Works:
- You can compute centroids for each weather type using historical data.
- A new observation is assigned to the nearest centroid, giving a quick prediction.
- Useful for low-resource environments or embedded systems.

---

## 🧭 2. **Climate Zone Identification**
### Use Case:
Classify geographic regions into climate zones (e.g. tropical, arid, temperate) based on long-term averages.
- Features: seasonal temperature ranges, rainfall patterns, humidity profiles.

### Why It Works:
- Centroids represent archetypal climate profiles.
- Can be used for educational tools or environmental planning.

---

## ⚠️ 3. **Storm Type Classification**
### Use Case:
Given radar or satellite-derived features, classify a storm as thunderstorm, cyclone, hurricane, etc.
- Features: wind shear, pressure gradients, cloud top temperature, rotation metrics.

### Why It Works:
- Centroids can represent typical storm signatures.
- Fast and interpretable for early warning systems.

---

## 🚫 Why It’s Not Ideal for Forecasting
- Weather prediction is inherently **temporal** and **continuous** — better suited to time-series models like LSTMs, GRUs, or physics-based simulations.
- Nearest Centroid lacks memory or sequence modeling, so it can’t capture trends or dynamics.

---

## 🧪 Hybrid Idea: Centroid-Based Regime Detection
You could use Nearest Centroid to classify the current atmospheric state into a regime (e.g. “pre-frontal,” “post-frontal,” “stable high-pressure”) and then trigger a more complex model for actual forecasting. Think of it as a **pre-filter** or **meta-model switcher**.

---



## Movie and Media Reccomendations

Definitely — Nearest Centroid can be adapted for **personalized recommendations**, especially when you frame user preferences and item attributes as vectors in a shared feature space. It’s not as nuanced as deep collaborative filtering or matrix factorization, but it’s fast, interpretable, and surprisingly effective in low-dimensional or well-structured domains. Here's how it could work:

---

## 🎯 How Nearest Centroid Can Power Recommendations

### 🧠 1. **User Preference Profiling**
- **Approach**: Represent each item (movie, song, book) as a feature vector — e.g. genre, mood, length, popularity, author/director style.
- **User Vector**: Compute the centroid of all items the user has liked. This becomes their “taste vector.”
- **Recommendation**: Suggest new items closest to this centroid in feature space.

---

### 📚 2. **Genre or Theme-Based Matching**
- **Approach**: Group items into clusters (e.g. sci-fi, romance, thriller) and compute centroids for each.
- **Use Case**: Recommend items from the cluster whose centroid is closest to the user’s taste vector.
- **Bonus**: You can visualize how a user’s preferences drift over time by tracking centroid shifts.

---

### 🎵 3. **Cold Start Solutions**
- **Problem**: New users or new items lack interaction data.
- **Solution**: Use metadata (e.g. tags, descriptions, artist similarity) to compute centroids and make initial recommendations.
- **Why It Works**: Centroid-based models don’t require dense user-item matrices.

---

## ⚙️ Example Pipeline

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestCentroid
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Sample item metadata
items = ["space opera sci-fi", "romantic drama", "dark psychological thriller"]
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(items)

# User likes item 0 and 2
user_likes = X[[0, 2]]
user_centroid = user_likes.mean(axis=0)

# Compute distances to all items
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import euclidean_distances
distances = euclidean_distances(X, user_centroid)
recommended_index = distances.argmin()
```

---

## 🔍 Real-World Datasets You Could Use
- **MovieLens**: Rich metadata and ratings for movies.
- **Last.fm or Spotify API**: Music preferences and audio features.
- **Goodreads**: Book ratings and genre tags.

---

Great question, Brian — and the answer depends on how you define “work well.” For a **Nearest Centroid-based recommender**, you don’t need massive data volumes to get meaningful results, but the quality and structure of the data matter more than sheer quantity. Let’s break it down:

---

## 📊 How Much Data Is “Enough”?

### ✅ **For Centroid-Based Systems**
- **User-level data**: A few dozen liked items per user can be enough to compute a meaningful “taste vector.”
- **Item-level metadata**: You’ll want rich, structured features (e.g. genre, mood, author, tempo, tags) for each item.
- **Class coverage**: If you're clustering items into categories (e.g. sci-fi, jazz, thrillers), each class should have enough examples to compute a stable centroid — maybe 50–100 per class.

### 🧠 **What Matters More Than Volume**
- **Feature richness**: Sparse vectors (e.g. just genre) won’t capture nuance. Dense vectors (e.g. TF-IDF, embeddings, audio features) make centroids more expressive.
- **User diversity**: If all users like the same things, centroids collapse. You want varied preferences to define meaningful clusters.
- **Label clarity**: If your training data has noisy or ambiguous labels (e.g. genre overlap), centroids become fuzzy.

---

## 🧪 Example: Movie Recommender
Let’s say you use the MovieLens dataset:
- **10,000 movies** with metadata (genre, tags, ratings)
- **1,000 users** with 20–100 rated movies each

You could:
- Compute genre centroids (e.g. average vector for “romantic comedy”)
- Compute each user’s preference centroid
- Recommend movies closest to that user’s centroid

This setup works surprisingly well — even with modest data — because the feature space is structured and interpretable.

---

## ⚠️ When You *Do* Need More Data
- If you want to model **subtle taste shifts** over time
- If your items have **high-dimensional embeddings** (e.g. BERT for books, MFCCs for music)
- If you’re trying to personalize across **multiple modalities** (e.g. books + music + movies)

---



## Adaptive Learning System

That’s a brilliant concept, Brian — and yes, a Nearest Centroid model could absolutely play a role in powering an **adaptive learning loop**, especially if you treat student knowledge states as vectors and use centroids to guide tutorial selection. Let’s sketch out how this could work:

---

## 🧠 Concept: Centroid-Guided Adaptive Learning System

### 🎯 Step 1: Represent Knowledge States
- Each quiz question maps to a **concept vector** (e.g. algebra, geometry, logic).
- A student’s responses form a **performance vector** — correct/incorrect across concepts.
- Over time, you compute a **student centroid** representing their current mastery profile.

---

### 📚 Step 2: Cluster Learning Materials
- Tutorials are tagged with concept vectors (e.g. “linear equations,” “proof by contradiction”).
- You compute centroids for each **tutorial cluster** — representing the average concept coverage.
- Match the student’s centroid to the nearest tutorial centroid to select the most relevant material.

---

### 🔁 Step 3: Iterate and Adapt
- After each tutorial, re-quiz the student.
- Update their performance vector and recompute their centroid.
- Repeat the matching process — gradually shifting toward more advanced or remedial content.

---

## Career Reccomendation System

That’s a fantastic idea, Brian — and yes, a Nearest Centroid model could absolutely be used to power a **career recommendation system** based on interests, aptitudes, and goals. It’s lightweight, interpretable, and well-suited for this kind of structured matching. Let’s break it down:

---

## 🎓 System Overview: Career Matching via Centroids

### 🧠 Step 1: Represent Student Profiles
Each student completes a quiz assessing:
- **Interests**: e.g. creative, analytical, social, technical
- **Aptitudes**: verbal, spatial, numerical, abstract reasoning
- **Goals**: income expectations, work-life balance, impact, autonomy

These responses form a **feature vector** representing the student’s profile.

---

### 🗂️ Step 2: Encode Career Paths
Each career is tagged with a vector based on:
- Required aptitudes (e.g. engineering needs spatial + numerical)
- Typical interests (e.g. counseling aligns with social + empathetic)
- Goal alignment (e.g. entrepreneurship scores high on autonomy)

You then compute **centroids** for clusters of careers — e.g. STEM, healthcare, arts, business — or treat each career as its own centroid.

---

### 🎯 Step 3: Match Student to Career Centroid
- Compute the **distance** between the student’s vector and each career centroid.
- Recommend careers whose centroids are closest.
- Optionally, show a ranked list with confidence scores based on proximity.

---

## 🧪 Bonus Features You Could Add

| Feature             | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Explainability**  | Show which traits contributed most to the match (e.g. “You scored high in spatial reasoning, which aligns with architecture”). |
| **Centroid Drift**  | Track how a student’s profile changes over time and how their career matches evolve. |
| **Peer Comparison** | Show how similar students matched to careers, using centroid clusters. |
| **Feedback Loop**   | Let students rate suggestions, and update centroids dynamically. |

---

## 🧰 Tools & Data Sources
- **O*NET**: Rich career metadata including required skills, interests, and work styles.
- **RIASEC model**: Holland’s interest framework (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional).
- **Custom quiz engine**: You could build this in React or Python with simple scoring logic.

## Personality Assessment

Absolutely — a personality self-assessment tool powered by a **Nearest Centroid model** is not only feasible, it’s refreshingly elegant. Instead of trying to predict personality traits with complex deep learning, you can use centroid-based clustering to match users to archetypal profiles based on their responses. Let’s break it down:

---

## 🧠 Concept: Centroid-Based Personality Profiler

### 🧩 Step 1: Define Personality Archetypes
Start with a framework like:
- **Big Five (OCEAN)**: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
- **DISC**: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness
- **MBTI**: 16 types based on cognitive preferences

Each archetype is represented by a **centroid vector** — the average response pattern of people who identify with that type.

---

### 📝 Step 2: Quiz the User
Design a questionnaire with Likert-scale items (e.g. “I enjoy social gatherings” → 1–5). Each response maps to a feature in the user’s vector.

---

### 🎯 Step 3: Match to Nearest Centroid
- Compute the Euclidean (or cosine) distance between the user’s vector and each archetype centroid.
- Assign the user to the closest one.
- Optionally, show a ranked list with confidence scores or distances.

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Feedback and Refinement
- Let users rate the accuracy of their match.
- Use that feedback to refine centroids over time.
- You could even allow users to “blend” between types if they’re equidistant.

---

## 🧪 Bonus Features You Could Add

| Feature                        | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Centroid Drift**             | Track how a user’s personality profile evolves over time — great for journaling or therapy tools. |
| **Career Matching**            | Link personality centroids to career clusters (e.g. high Openness → creative fields). |
| **Relationship Compatibility** | Compare centroid vectors between users to suggest compatibility or communication tips. |
| **Visualization**              | Show the user’s position in personality space relative to other types — like a radar chart or PCA plot. |

---

## 🧰 Tools & Data Sources
- [O*NET](https://www.onetonline.org/) for personality–career mappings
- [DISC GitHub implementation](https://github.com/lscarso/DISC) with centroid logic in Excel
- [Scikit-learn’s NearestCentroid](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestCentroid.html) for fast prototyping

---



Alright, let’s put some bones on this personality self‑assessment tool so you can see exactly how a **Nearest Centroid** model could drive it.

---

## 🧩 **Prototype Overview**

The idea is to:
1. Have a bank of quiz questions mapped to personality dimensions.
2. Represent answers as numerical feature vectors.
3. Compare a user’s vector to predefined personality type centroids.
4. Return the closest match, with an explanation.

---

## 1️⃣ **Feature Space Definition**

Let’s pick a concrete framework for the first prototype — say **Big Five** — and use 5 features:

| Feature           | Scale | Example Question                        |
| ----------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| Openness          | 1–5   | “I enjoy trying new things.”            |
| Conscientiousness | 1–5   | “I like to plan ahead.”                 |
| Extraversion      | 1–5   | “I’m energized by social situations.”   |
| Agreeableness     | 1–5   | “I value cooperation over competition.” |
| Neuroticism       | 1–5   | “I get stressed easily.”                |

Responses are turned into a 5‑dimensional vector.

---

## 2️⃣ **Centroid Setup**

Let’s say we pre‑define centroids for a handful of archetypes:

| Type          | Openness | Conscientiousness | Extraversion | Agreeableness | Neuroticism |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| The Visionary | 4.5      | 3.0               | 4.2          | 3.8           | 2.1         |
| The Planner   | 3.2      | 4.8               | 2.9          | 3.5           | 2.4         |
| The Connector | 3.8      | 3.2               | 4.9          | 4.5           | 2.7         |
| The Analyst   | 4.9      | 4.2               | 2.6          | 3.0           | 2.2         |

These numbers are just illustrative — in a real system you’d average actual survey data.

---

## 3️⃣ **Workflow**

1. **Quiz Phase**  
   - Present ~20 questions covering all dimensions.
   - Store responses in a vector `u`.

2. **Matching Phase**  
   - Compute distance from `u` to each personality centroid.
   - Use Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.

3. **Result Phase**  
   - Show the best match plus top‑N alternatives.
   - Include a short descriptive blurb per personality type.
   - Optionally show how close the user was to other centroids (“You’re 85% Planner, 80% Visionary”).

---

## 4️⃣ **Example Pseudocode**

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestCentroid
import numpy as np

# Example centroids and labels
X = np.array([
    [4.5, 3.0, 4.2, 3.8, 2.1],  # Visionary
    [3.2, 4.8, 2.9, 3.5, 2.4],  # Planner
    [3.8, 3.2, 4.9, 4.5, 2.7],  # Connector
    [4.9, 4.2, 2.6, 3.0, 2.2]   # Analyst
])
y = ["Visionary", "Planner", "Connector", "Analyst"]

clf = NearestCentroid()
clf.fit(X, y)

# Example user answers vector
user_vec = np.array([[4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5]])
prediction = clf.predict(user_vec)
print("Your type:", prediction[0])
```

---

## 5️⃣ **Possible Extensions**
- **Blended types**: Use weighted similarities to show mixed profiles.
- **Over‑time tracking**: Store user vectors from multiple sessions to visualize personality drift.
- **Domain linking**: Map personality type to career suggestions, learning styles, or team roles.
- **Interactive visualizations**: Radar charts or PCA plots for “personality space” exploration.

---



Perfect — let’s flesh this out into a **fully runnable mini‑prototype** so you can see the whole loop in action. I’ll make it self‑contained and easy to extend into a web app or CLI tool later.

---

## 🧩 **Prototype: Centroid‑Based Personality Profiler**

### 1. **Question Bank**
Here’s a small set (you’d want ~20+ for real use):

```python
questions = [
    ("I enjoy trying new things.", "openness"),
    ("I like to plan ahead.", "conscientiousness"),
    ("I’m energized by social situations.", "extraversion"),
    ("I value cooperation over competition.", "agreeableness"),
    ("I get stressed easily.", "neuroticism"),
    ("I enjoy abstract ideas and theories.", "openness"),
    ("I keep my workspace tidy.", "conscientiousness"),
    ("I seek out group activities.", "extraversion"),
    ("I avoid conflict whenever possible.", "agreeableness"),
    ("I worry about things I can’t control.", "neuroticism"),
]
```

### 2. **Centroid Definitions**
We’ll define archetypes with 1–5 Likert averages per Big Five trait:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestCentroid

# Order: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism
centroids = np.array([
    [4.5, 3.0, 4.2, 3.8, 2.1],  # Visionary
    [3.2, 4.8, 2.9, 3.5, 2.4],  # Planner
    [3.8, 3.2, 4.9, 4.5, 2.7],  # Connector
    [4.9, 4.2, 2.6, 3.0, 2.2]   # Analyst
])

labels = ["Visionary", "Planner", "Connector", "Analyst"]
```

---

### 3. **Quiz + Scoring Logic**
This will collect responses, aggregate per trait, and compare to centroids.

```python
# Map traits to index in vector
trait_index = {
    "openness": 0,
    "conscientiousness": 1,
    "extraversion": 2,
    "agreeableness": 3,
    "neuroticism": 4
}

def run_quiz():
    scores = np.zeros(5)  # 5 traits
    counts = np.zeros(5)

    print("Rate each statement from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree):\n")
    for q, trait in questions:
        rating = None
        while rating not in [1,2,3,4,5]:
            try:
                rating = int(input(f"{q} "))
            except ValueError:
                continue
        idx = trait_index[trait]
        scores[idx] += rating
        counts[idx] += 1

    # Average per trait
    scores = scores / counts
    return scores
```

---

### 4. **Classification**
```python
def classify(user_vec):
    clf = NearestCentroid()
    clf.fit(centroids, labels)
    prediction = clf.predict([user_vec])[0]
    distances = np.linalg.norm(centroids - user_vec, axis=1)
    return prediction, distances

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_vec = run_quiz()
    p, dist = classify(user_vec)
    print("\nYour personality type:", p)
    print("Distances to other types:", dict(zip(labels, dist)))
```

---

## 💡 How to Extend This
- **More questions** → better stability.
- **Descriptive blurbs** for each type (strengths, challenges, career suggestions).
- **Visualization** → radar charts using `matplotlib` to plot the user profile vs. their centroid.
- **Longitudinal tracking** → save `user_vec` to a database over time and plot “personality drift.”

Alright, Brian — let’s spin up a **minimal, ready‑to‑run Jupyter Notebook** version of our centroid‑driven personality profiler. This way you can load it into a notebook, run a few simulated “users,” and see the model classify them while also visualizing profiles.

---

## 📓 Notebook‑Friendly Prototype

```python
# Personality Profiler — Nearest Centroid (Jupyter Notebook Version)

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestCentroid
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# --- 1. Question Bank (Toy Set) ---
questions = [
    ("I enjoy trying new things.", "openness"),
    ("I like to plan ahead.", "conscientiousness"),
    ("I’m energized by social situations.", "extraversion"),
    ("I value cooperation over competition.", "agreeableness"),
    ("I get stressed easily.", "neuroticism"),
    ("I enjoy abstract ideas and theories.", "openness"),
    ("I keep my workspace tidy.", "conscientiousness"),
    ("I seek out group activities.", "extraversion"),
    ("I avoid conflict whenever possible.", "agreeableness"),
    ("I worry about things I can’t control.", "neuroticism"),
]

trait_index = {
    "openness": 0,
    "conscientiousness": 1,
    "extraversion": 2,
    "agreeableness": 3,
    "neuroticism": 4
}

# --- 2. Predefined Centroids ---
centroids = np.array([
    [4.5, 3.0, 4.2, 3.8, 2.1],  # Visionary
    [3.2, 4.8, 2.9, 3.5, 2.4],  # Planner
    [3.8, 3.2, 4.9, 4.5, 2.7],  # Connector
    [4.9, 4.2, 2.6, 3.0, 2.2]   # Analyst
])

labels = ["Visionary", "Planner", "Connector", "Analyst"]

clf = NearestCentroid()
clf.fit(centroids, labels)

# --- 3. Simulate User Responses ---
def simulate_user(responses):
    """
    responses: list of ints (1-5) matching 'questions' order
    Returns: averaged trait vector
    """
    scores = np.zeros(5)
    counts = np.zeros(5)
    for (q, trait), rating in zip(questions, responses):
        idx = trait_index[trait]
        scores[idx] += rating
        counts[idx] += 1
    return scores / counts

# Example simulated users
users = {
    "Alice": [5,3,4,4,2,5,2,4,4,2],  # Likely Visionary
    "Ben":   [3,5,3,3,2,3,5,2,3,2],  # Likely Planner
    "Cara":  [4,3,5,5,3,4,2,5,5,3],  # Likely Connector
    "Dan":   [5,4,3,3,2,5,4,2,2,2]   # Likely Analyst
}

# --- 4. Classify + Visualize ---
results = []

for name, resp in users.items():
    vec = simulate_user(resp)
    pred = clf.predict([vec])[0]
    dist = np.linalg.norm(centroids - vec, axis=1)
    results.append((name, pred, dict(zip(labels, dist))))
    
    # Radar chart
    traits = list(trait_index.keys())
    angles = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, len(traits), endpoint=False).tolist()
    vec_cycle = np.concatenate((vec, [vec[0]]))
    angles_cycle = angles + [angles[0]]
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(4,4))
    ax = plt.subplot(111, polar=True)
    ax.plot(angles_cycle, vec_cycle, 'o-', linewidth=2, label=f"{name} ({pred})")
    ax.fill(angles_cycle, vec_cycle, alpha=0.25)
    ax.set_thetagrids(np.degrees(angles), traits)
    ax.set_ylim(0,5)
    plt.title(f"{name} Profile — {pred}")
    plt.legend(loc='upper right')
    plt.show()

# --- 5. Results Table ---
pd.DataFrame(results, columns=["Name", "Predicted Type", "Distances"])
```

---

### 🔍 What This Notebook Does
1. **Sets up** a tiny quiz + Big Five trait mapping.
2. **Defines archetype centroids** for matching.
3. **Simulates multiple “users”** with fixed answers.
4. **Classifies** each user into the nearest personality type.
5. **Plots** radar charts to visually compare profiles to centroid traits.
6. Outputs a **DataFrame** showing distances to all types.

---

💡 **Next Steps You Could Explore**
- Replace simulated responses with **interactive input widgets** (`ipywidgets`) for live testing.
- Expand question bank to ~40–50 items for stability.
- Store results in a CSV or small database to track personality changes over time.
- Add **blended personality output** using weighted distances.
