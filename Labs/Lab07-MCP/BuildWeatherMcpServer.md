<h1>Build a Weather MCP Server</h1>

[TOC]

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides weather forecasts and alerts. This tutorial was adapted from [Build an MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-server). The purpose was to simplify the tutorial for beginning Python programmers. The main changes were to use `pip` instead of `uv`,  use the ["official" MCP Server SDK](https://modelcontextprotocol.github.io/python-sdk/) and to not use [Python type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

This tutorial includes instructions for testing the server with two different MCP clients: 

- Claude Desktop
- VS Code

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher.
- [Claude Desktop App](https://claude.ai/download) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed.



## Project Setup

We will use standard Python tools (`venv` and `pip`) to set up the environment. The environment will include the ["official" Python MCP SDK](https://modelcontextprotocol.github.io/python-sdk/) from the Anthropic MCP open-source project. 

- First make a new project folder with a name like `weather-mcp`
  - In that folder, using a terminal, do the following :

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv weather-venv

# 2. Activate the environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source weather-venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
weather-venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install the official Python MCP SDK with CLI tools
# and install httpx, a modern, fast, asynchronous HTTP client library
cd weather-venv
pip install "mcp[cli]" httpx
cd ..
```

**Note**: on a Mac, use the command `python3` instead of `python`.

## Writing the Server

Create a file named `server.py` in *weather-mcp*. To keep things simple and avoid complex type definitions, we will define our tool inputs using standard Python dictionaries.

```python
import asyncio
import httpx
from mcp.server.models import InitializationOptions
import mcp.types as types
from mcp.server import NotificationOptions, Server
from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server

# Create and initialize the server object
server = Server("weather-server")

# NWS requires a User-Agent header to identify your app
NWS_HEADERS = {
    "User-Agent": "weather-mcp-server/1.0",
    "Accept": "application/geo+json"
}

# --- 1. Define the Logic ---

async def get_forecast(latitude, longitude):
    """

    Args:

    """
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:

        long_clean = f"{float(longitude):.4f}"
        points_url = f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat_clean},{long_clean}"

if __name__ == "__main__":

## Testing

### Configuring Claude Desktop as a Client

Now we need to tell the Claude Desktop app where to find this script. We do this by editing a configuration file.

1. **Locate the configuration file:**

   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

   *If the file doesn't exist, create it.*

2. Add your server configuration:

   You must use the absolute path to the python executable inside your virtual environment so Claude can run it without needing you to activate the environment manually.

   *Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/` with the actual path on your machine.*

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "weather-server": {
         "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/weather-mcp/weather-venv/bin/python",
         "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/weather-mcp/server.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   > **Note for Windows Users:** Your paths will look like `C:\\Users\\Name\\weather-mcp\\weather-venv\\Scripts\\python.exe`. You need to escape the backslashes `\\` in JSON.

#### Testing with Claude Desktop

1. **Restart Claude Desktop:** You must quit and reopen the app for the config to load.

2. **Look for the weather-server:** Click on the "select tools" button, you should see *weather-server.* If you click it, you should see  *get-forecast* and *get-alerts*.

3. **Ask a Question**:

   - For the weather forecast, you can ask either by latitude and logitude <u>or</u> by city and state. For example:
     - What is the forecast for lat 44.0521, lon 123.0868?
     - What is the forecast for Springfield, OR?

   Claude will:
   
   1. Ask for permission to use the tool.
   2. Run your Python script in the background.
   3. Get the result ("sunny with a high of 75°F").
   4. Write a response based on that data.



### Configuring VS Code as a Client

To switch from Claude Desktop to VS Code (GitHub Copilot) as a client, you only need to make a configuration file for use with VS Code. Nothing needs to be changed in the server code.

Instead of creating  a global config file like you did for Claude, you will create a project-specific config file for VS Code.

**Instructions:**

1. Inside your `weather-mcp` folder, create a new subfolder named `.vscode`.

2. Inside that folder, create a file named `mcp.json`.

3. Add the following configuration.

   - **Note:** The root key in the JSON changes from `mcpServers` (for Claude) to `servers` (for VS Code).

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "weather-server": {
         "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/weather-mcp/venv/bin/python",
         "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/weather-mcp/server.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   *(Remember to use double backslashes `\\` in paths if you are on Windows.)*

#### Testing with VS Code

Use the Copilot Chat sidebar.

**Instructions:**

1. **Reload VS Code:** Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows), type "Reload Window", and press Enter to ensure the new config is loaded.

2. **Open Copilot Chat:** Click the Chat icon in the sidebar.

3. **Select agent mode:** In the agent/ask/plan drop-down, select agent. 

4. **Enable the weather server tool.** Cllick on the *configure tools* icon. In the list of tools, you should see `weather-server` listed. Check it's checkbox.

5. Ask a Question:

   - For the weather forecast, you can ask either by latitude and logitude <u>or</u> by city and state. For example:
     - What is the forecast for lat 44.0521, lon 123.0868?
     - What is the forecast for Springfield, OR?

   Claude will:

   1. Ask for permission to use the tool.
   2. Run your Python script in the background.
   3. Get the result ("sunny with a high of 75°F").
   4. Write a response based on that data.



## Troubleshooting

If the *weather-server* doesn't appear in the list of tools or the tool fails:

1. Check the logs:
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp.log`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp.log`
2. Ensure you used the <u>absolute path</u> to the python executable in the `weather-venv` folder, not the system python.
