<h1>Lab 7: Model Context Protocol</h1>



[TOC]

## Objectives

- Learn how to work with the MCP protocol.
- Build an MCP server.
- Build an MCP client.

## Instructions

You have three options. You can <u>do any one</u> of these:

1. Follow tutorials to build an MCP server and client
   - Follow [this tutorial to build an MCP weather server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-server), or [your instrcutor's simplified version](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CS210-CourseMaterials/Labs/Lab07-MCP/BuildWeatherMcpServer.html) of the tutorial.
   - Follow [this tutorial to build an MCP client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-client), or [your instrcutor's simplified version](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CS210-CourseMaterials/Labs/Lab07-MCP/BuildWeatherMcpClient.html) of the tutorial.   
                                                    OR
2. Write an MCP server to do something useful for the app you wrote in the previous lab. Incorporate an MCP client into the app from your previous lab.  
                                                          OR
3. Come up with your own idea for an MCP server, write it, and write a client.

**Note**: it's ok to use AI to assist you with your coding.



## Submitting your lab work on Moodle

### Beta Version

- Post a zip file or GitHub link for the beta version of your project in your team channel on Discord.

### Code Review

- Review code written by one of your lab partners and share the review with them.
- Submit a copy of the code review <u>you did</u> on the LMS.

### Production Version

 Based on the code review and helpful advice from your lab partners, you may revise your code. On the code review from your lab partner, complete the “Prod.” column to show what you revised. Upload the following to the *Lab Production Version* assignment on the LMS:

1. The Zipped project files or a link to your GitHub repository.
3. The code review <u>from your lab partner</u> with the “Prod.” column filled out by you.



## Grading Criteria

The main focus of grading will be on program design, problem solving skills, AI-assisted coding and on testing (quality assurance).
