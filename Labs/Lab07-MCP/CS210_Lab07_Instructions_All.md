<h1>Lab 7: Model Context Protocol</h1>



[TOC]

## Objectives

- Learn how to work with the MCP protocol.
- Build an MCP server.
- Build an MCP client.

## Instructions

You have three options. You can <u>do any one</u> of these:

1. Follow tutorials to build an MCP server and client
   - Follow [this tutorial to build an MCP weather server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-server), or [your instructor's simplified version](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CS210-CourseMaterials/Labs/Lab07-MCP/BuildWeatherMcpServer.html) of the tutorial.
   - Follow [this tutorial to build an MCP client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-client), or [your instructor's simplified version](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CS210-CourseMaterials/Labs/Lab07-MCP/BuildWeatherMcpClient.html) of the tutorial.   
                                                    OR
2. Write an MCP server to do something useful for the app you wrote in the previous lab. Incorporate an MCP client into the app from your previous lab.  
                                                          OR
3. Come up with your own idea for an MCP server, write it, and write a client.

**Note**: it's ok to use AI to assist you with your coding.



## Submitting your lab work on Moodle

No code review is needed for this lab assignment.

### Production Version

Submit two screen-shots:

- One of either GitHub Copilot in VS Code or Claude Desktop responding to a forecast request
- One of the client running in a terminal and responding to a forecast request.

You don't need to submit code unless you did something other than just the tutorial&mdash;in which case, you didn't need to write any code. 



## Grading Criteria

The main focus of grading will be on problem solving skills in terms of getting everything set up so that your MCP server and client run properly.
