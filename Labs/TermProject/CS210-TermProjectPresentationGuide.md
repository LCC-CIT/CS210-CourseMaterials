# Term Project Presentation Guidelines

The purpose of the presentation is to show off the AI empowered app you made and to tell us a little about how it works and your experience creating it. It's fun to for everyone to see each other's apps!

- The presentation should be about 5 minutes long.
- Tell us what:
  - you are most proud of.
  - was hardest to do.
  - was the most important thing you learned.
- You can make your presentation one of three ways:

  - In person: you will give a live presentation to the class.  
    You can use Zoom on your computer so students on Zoom and in the classroom (on the D-Ten) can see your app running.
  - On Zoom: You will share your screen and the instructor will project that for the class to see.
  - Online (asynchronous): You can make a screen-cast and post a link to it in the presentation forum on Moodle. If you are making a screen-cast you can use any screen capture software that both records the screen and audio narration such as:
    - [ScreenPal (formerly Screencast-O-Matic)](https://screenpal.com)&mdash;free for 15 minute or shorter recordings.
    - [ScreenRec](https://screenrec.com/)&mdash;free!
    - [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com)&mdash;Meet with your team on Zoom, use webcams and/or mics, share your screen and record the meeting.
