<h1>Lab 5: AI Assisted Coding</h1>



[TOC]

## Introduction

In this lab you will use an AI-coding assistant like GitHub Copilot to write code for a moderately complex app. This will be a console based app in order to minimize complexity. (Unless you have experience writing code for a GUI and want to do that.)

This week's app will be modified next week by adding calls to a generative AI *chat completion API* in order to enhance the app with an AI feature.

## Instructions

Since everyone will potentially be choosing different apps to write and they will probably be designed and coded differently, there won't be three versions of this lab assignment. But here are suggestions for the types of apps you could write:

- Flash card or quiz generator
  - For this lab load questions and answers from a file.
  - In the next lab have AI generate the Q and A.
- A console based game
  - For this lab two humans would play on one computer.
  - For the next lab, the human would play against an AI player.
  - Some possibilities for games would be:
    - Checkers
    - Chess
    - Dungeon crawler
    - Text based quest
    - Dice game
    - Card game
- A more comprehensive expert system.
  - For this lab you would use an AI coding assistant to either improve the expert system you made earlier or make a new rule-based one. Possible enhancements would be: a progressive interview loop and a larger set of rules.
  - For the next lab you would use AI to do an interview and make decisions instead of the rule-based system.



## Submitting your lab work on Moodle

### Beta Version

- Post a zip file or GitHub link for the beta version of your project in your team channel on Discord.

### Code Review

- Review one of your lab partners' code and post the review in your team channel on Discord.
- Submit a copy of the code review <u>you did</u> on the LMS.

### Production Version

 Based on the code review and helpful advice from your lab partners, you may revise your code. On the code review from your lab partner, complete the “Prod.” column to show what you revised. Upload the following to the *Lab Production Version* assignment on the LMS:

1. The Zipped Python (.py) and any other project files or a link to your GitHub repository.
3. The code review <u>from your lab partner</u> with the “Prod.” column filled out by you.



## Grading Criteria

The main focus of grading will be on program design, problem solving skills, AI-assisted coding and on testing (quality assurance).
