<h1>Lab 2, An Improved Expert System</h1>

<h2>Group B</h2>

**CS 210, Intro to AI Programming**

## A Better Expert System

In the last lab assignment you wrote a "toy" expert system that was a Server Status and Priority Alert System. This week your assignment is to make a "mini" expert systeb by either:

A. Improving last week's program  
    or  
B. Making a new expert system to do something you are interesed in. Send your instructor a email or message describing what you want to do and get approval before writing your code.

## Requirements

1. Write a set of rules. There should be at least 6.
2. The rules will be designed for *forward chaining*. 
3. The rules for the system will be stored in a csv file.
4. The program will load the contents of the csv file into a List of Dictionaries.
5. The inference part of your program will implement *forward chaining*.
6. User input and output should be separated from code that does inference.
7. There will be a module that runs tests on the primary inference function and checks all combinations of inputs that the system can recognize.



## Submitting your lab work on Moodle

### Beta Version

- Post the beta version of both programs to your team channel in Discord.

### Code Review

- Review one of your lab partners' code and post the review in your team channel on Discord.
- Submit a copy of the code review <u>you did</u> on Moodle.

### Production Version

 Based on the code review and helpful advice from your lab partners, you may revise your code. On the code review from your lab partner, complete the “Prod.” column to show what you revised. Upload the following to the *Lab Production Version* assignment on Moodle:

1. The files: Python (.py) files (one or more) and one .csv rule file.
2. The code review <u>from your lab partner</u> with the “Prod.” column filled out by you.

### Grading Criteria

The main focus of grading will be on rule design and problem solving skills.
