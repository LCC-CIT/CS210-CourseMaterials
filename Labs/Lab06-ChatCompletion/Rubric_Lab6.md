# Rubric for Lab 6

## Adding an AI feature to the lab 6 app

Since I already graded code quality and unit tests (or some kind of test) for the non-ai version, I'm not checking that again here.

Should there be some kind of automated testing of the AI feature?

Things to check:

- AI prompts: (effectiveness and economy)
  - Static prompt
  - Dynamic prompt (takes into account user input in some way)
- Secure management of the API key
- Quality of AI code
- Effetiveness of the AI feature (was it a good idea, how well does it work)
