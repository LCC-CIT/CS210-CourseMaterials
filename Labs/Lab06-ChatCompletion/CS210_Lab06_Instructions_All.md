<h1>Lab 6: Calling a Chat Completion API</h1>



[TOC]

## Objective

In this lab you will modify the app you built in the previous lab by adding calls to a *chat completion API* in order to enhance the app with an AI feature.

## Instructions

Since everyone is building different apps there aren't three versions of this lab assignment. 

Add a call to the Gemini chat completion API or some other generative chat completion API to add a feature to the app. For example, if the app is a game, add an AI opponent. 

If the app is not a game, add an AI feature that does something in response to the user's input. This should be more than just giving answers (don't just make a chatbot), but the AI featuere should do some kind of decision making based on the user's input or the state of the app and then the app should do something based on the response from the AI.

## Submitting your lab work on Moodle

### Beta Version

- Post a zip file or GitHub link for the beta version of your project in your team channel on Discord.

### Code Review

- Review one of your lab partners' code and post the review in your team channel on Discord.
- Submit a copy of the code review <u>you did</u> on the LMS.

### Production Version

 Based on the code review and helpful advice from your lab partners, you may revise your code. On the code review from your lab partner, complete the “Prod.” column to show what you revised. Upload the following to the *Lab Production Version* assignment on the LMS:

1. The Zipped project files or a link to your GitHub repository.
3. The code review <u>from your lab partner</u> with the “Prod.” column filled out by you.



## Grading Criteria

The main focus of grading will be on program design, problem solving skills, AI-assisted coding and on testing (quality assurance).
