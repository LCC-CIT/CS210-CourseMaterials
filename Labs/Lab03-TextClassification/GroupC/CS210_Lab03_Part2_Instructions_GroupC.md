<h1>Lab 3: Working with Text Data</h1>

<h2>Group C</h2>

[TOC]

## Part 1: The scikit-learn "Working with Text Data" Tutorial

The instructions for part 1 are [here](../CS210_Lab03_Part1_Instructions.html).
Part 1 has it's own assignment submission link on the LMS.



## Part 2: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

You will do Exercise 2, Sentiment Analysis on movie reviews, which is at the end of the ["Working with Text Data" tutorial](../../../Tutorials/scikit-learn-1.7/WorkingWithTextData.html). The skeleton code for this exercise imports the perceptron classifier, but you may use whatever classifier you wish. You might prefer to use the Multinomial Naive Bays or the Support Vector Machine classifier used in the tutorial.

Alternatively, you can do a classification project of your own design.  You can browse the [scikit-learn datset loaders](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html) page for ideas. Let me know if you would have something to propose. It would be very cool to see some of you do a mini-project of your own choosing!



## Submitting your lab work on Moodle

### Beta Version

- Post the beta version of your Python file to your team channel in Discord.

### Code Review

- Review one of your lab partners' code and post the review in your team channel on Discord.
- Submit a copy of the code review <u>you did</u> on the LMS.

### Production Version

 Based on the code review and helpful advice from your lab partners, you may revise your code. On the code review from your lab partner, complete the “Prod.” column to show what you revised. Upload the following to the *Lab Production Version* assignment on the LMS:

1. The Python (.py) file
3. The code review <u>from your lab partner</u> with the “Prod.” column filled out by you.



## Grading Criteria

The main focus of grading will be on use of the sckit-learn classes and problem solving skills.
