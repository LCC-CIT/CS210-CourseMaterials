## Lab 3: Working with Text Data

This week's lab assignment will be to obtain a text data set that can be used with a naive Bayes classifier. You will prepare the data set for training and partition it into training and test data sets. Then you will train the scikit-learn naive Bayes classifier and test it. 

The specific instructions for each version of the lab assignment will be coming soon.

If you have a particular classification project you would like to do and know how or where to get the data, let me know. It would be very cool to see some of you do projects of your own choosing!



## Submitting your lab work on Moodle

### Beta Version

- Post the beta version of both programs to your team channel in Discord.

### Code Review

- Review one of your lab partners' code and post the review in your team channel on Discord.
- Submit a copy of the code review <u>you did</u> on Moodle.

### Production Version

 Based on the code review and helpful advice from your lab partners, you may revise your code. On the code review from your lab partner, complete the “Prod.” column to show what you revised. Upload the following to the *Lab Production Version* assignment on Moodle:

1. The Python (.py) file
3. The code review <u>from your lab partner</u> with the “Prod.” column filled out by you.

### Grading Criteria

The main focus of grading will be on rule design and problem solving skills.
