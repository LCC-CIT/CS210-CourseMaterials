<h1>Image Classification with TensorFlow</h1>

<h2>TensorFlow QuickStart Explained</h2>

[toc]

This tutorial teaches the basics of building a neural network with TensorFlow. You'll learn how to load and prepare a dataset, build a simple neural network model, train it, and then evaluate its performance. The primary goal is to classify images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## ## Conceptual Steps

### 1. Set up TensorFlow

- **Concept:** Before you can use any library in your code, you need to import it. This makes the functions and classes defined in the library available for you to use.
- **In the tutorial:** The first step is to import the TensorFlow library. This is a necessary first step to access all the tools needed to build and train your model.

### 2. Load a dataset

- **Concept:** Machine learning models learn from data. Before you can train a model, you need to load a dataset and prepare it for training. This often involves preprocessing the data, such as scaling or normalizing it.
- **In the tutorial:** The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is loaded. The pixel values of the images are scaled from a range of 0-255 to a range of 0-1. This is a common practice in machine learning that helps the model train more efficiently.

### 3. Build a machine learning model

- **Concept:** A neural network is built by stacking layers of neurons[^1]. Each layer transforms the data it receives from the previous layer. The `Sequential` model in Keras[^2] is a simple way to create a model where the data flows sequentially through the layers.
- **In the tutorial:** A `tf.keras.Sequential` model is built with three layers:
  - **Flatten:** This layer converts the 2D image data into a 1D array.
  - **Dense:** This is a fully connected neural network layer.
  - **Dropout:** This layer randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 during training to prevent overfitting.

### 4. Train and evaluate your model

- **Concept:** Training a model involves showing it the data and letting it learn the patterns. The model's predictions are compared to the actual labels, and a **loss function** is used to calculate how wrong the predictions are. An **optimizer** then adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the loss.
- **In the tutorial:**
  - The model is **compiled** with an optimizer, a loss function, and a metric to monitor.
  - The `fit()` method is used to train the model on the training data.
  - The `evaluate()` method is used to check the model's performance on the test data.

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to building a simple neural network for image classification. It illustrates several fundamental concepts in machine learning and artificial neural networks, including:

- **Data Preprocessing:** The importance of preparing data before training a model.
- **Model Building:** How to create a neural network by stacking layers.
- **Loss Function and Optimizer:** The core components of the training process that guide the model's learning.
- **Training and Evaluation:** The process of fitting a model to data and then evaluating its performance on unseen data.
- **Overfitting:** The use of dropout as a technique to prevent the model from memorizing the training data and failing to generalize to new data.

[^1]: In Keras, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) layers are represented as distinct, instantiable Python objects, primarily found within the `tf.keras.layers` module. Each layer object encapsulates the specific mathematical transformation it performs (like the weighted sum and activation of a `Dense` layer) and manages its own trainable parameters (weights and biases). As seen in Step 3 of the tutorial, these layer objects, such as `tf.keras.layers.Flatten`, `tf.keras.layers.Dense`, and `tf.keras.layers.Dropout`, are created and then organized into a model. The `tf.keras.models.Sequential` model is the simplest way to do this, taking a list of these layer instances and stacking them in order, automatically connecting the output of one layer to the input of the next, thus building the complete network architecture.
[^2]: A *Sequential model* in Keras is the simplest way to build a neural network. It's exactly what it sounds like: a plain, linear stack of layers, one after the other. Think of it as a simple pipeline.  Data goes in the top, passes through the first layer, then its output becomes the input for the second layer, and so on, until it comes out the last layer. The key characteristics are: **Linear Stack:** It's a single, straight path from input to output. **One-to-One Layers:** Each layer in the model has exactly one input and one output.
