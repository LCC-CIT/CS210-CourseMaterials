## Keras Image Classification with the EMNIST (Letters) Dataset

### Objective:

Your goal is to apply the same steps as those in the "[Basic image classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)" tutorial (which used the Fashion MNIST dataset) to a new,  EMNIST (Letters) dataset to build a handwritten letter (A-Z) classifier. This dataset has the same image shape as the tutorial, but a different number of classes (26 instead of 10).

This will test your understanding of:

- Loading a new dataset from `tensorflow_datasets`.
- Adapting the model's **final layer** to match the number of classes.
- Confirming that the rest of the model and training process remains the same.

**The New Dataset: EMNIST/Letters** This dataset contains 145,600 (88,800 training, 14,800 testing) **28x28 grayscale images** of 26 different handwritten capital letters (A-Z).

### Instructions

Use a Google Colab notebook. The only *real* change is in Step 2 (loading) and one line in Step 5 (building the model).

**Step 1: Import Libraries** You'll need `tensorflow`, `tensorflow_datasets` (tfds), `numpy`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds  # We'll use this to load EMNIST
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

**Step 2: Load the Data** Like KMNIST, we'll use `tfds` to load this dataset. I've included the helper code again to convert it back to the simple NumPy arrays you're used to.

```python
# 1. Load the EMNIST/letters data using tfds
(ds_train, ds_test), ds_info = tfds.load(
    'emnist/letters',
    split=['train', 'test'],
    shuffle_files=True,
    as_supervised=True,  # Returns (image, label) tuples
    with_info=True,
)

# 2. Convert the data to the NumPy arrays
def convert_to_numpy(dataset):
    images = []
    labels = []
    for img, lbl in dataset:
        images.append(img)
        labels.append(lbl)
    return np.array(images), np.array(labels)

print("Converting training data to NumPy...")
train_images, train_labels = convert_to_numpy(ds_train)
print("Converting test data to NumPy...")
test_images, test_labels = convert_to_numpy(ds_test)

# 3. Create the class names, from 'A' to 'Z'
#    The labels are 0-25.
class_names = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 
               'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 
               'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
```

*Note: The labels in this dataset are actually 0-25. `tfds` loads them correctly. The EMNIST dataset itself has some quirks, but `tfds` handles them.*

**Step 3: Explore the Data** 100% identical. Check the shapes.

- `train_images.shape` should be `(88800, 28, 28, 1)`.
- `train_labels.shape` should be `(88800,)`.

**Step 4: Preprocess the Data** 100% identical. The pixel values are 0-255.

```python
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0
```

**Step 5: Build the Model (THE MAIN CHALLENGE)** This is the core of the exercise. The `input_shape` is the same, but the *output* is different.

- The tutorial's model was for 10 classes (`Dense(10)`).
- This dataset has 26 classes.

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    
    # YOU MUST CHANGE THIS LINE!
    # How many neurons for the final layer?
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(26) 
])

model.summary()
```

**Step 6: Compile the Model** 100% identical. `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` is perfect. It's built for multi-class problems where the labels are simple integers (which ours are, 0-25).

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

**Step 7: Train the Model** 100% identical.

```python
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)
```

You should see pretty good accuracy again!

**Step 8 & 9: Evaluate and Make Predictions** The code is identical. You can use all the same plotting functions, and thanks to your `class_names` list, you'll see the model correctly predicting "T", "G", "A", etc.

### Bonus Challenge (Optional)

The simple model from the tutorial works well, but can we improve it? A "deeper" model (with more layers) can sometimes learn more complex patterns.

Try modifying **Step 5 (Build the Model)**. After the `Dense(128, activation='relu')` layer, try adding **another** `Dense` layer (e.g., 64 neurons, also with `relu` activation) before the final `Dense(26)` layer.

Your new model would look like this:

```Python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    
    # Add the new layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(26)
])
```

Re-compile and re-train this new, "deeper" model. Does the final test accuracy get better or worse?
