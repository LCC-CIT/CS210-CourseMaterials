## Keras Image Classification with the CIFAR-10 Dataset

### Objective:

Your goal is to apply the exact same steps you learned in the "[Basic image classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)" tutorial (which used the Fashion MNIST dataset) to a new, slightly more complex dataset: CIFAR-10.

This will test your understanding of:

- Loading a standard Keras dataset.
- Exploring and understanding the *shape* and *type* of your data.
- Adapting the model's first layer to match your new data's input shape.
- Building, compiling, training, and evaluating a basic neural network.

The New Dataset: CIFAR-10

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a "Hello, World" of computer vision. It contains 60,000 32x32 color images (50,000 training, 10,000 testing) divided into 10 classes:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

### Instructions

Use a Google Colab notebook and follow the structure from the tutorial. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to adapt it.

Step 1: Import Libraries

This is the same as the tutorial. You'll need tensorflow (as tf), numpy, and matplotlib.pyplot.

Python

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Step 2: Load the Data

Instead of fashion_mnist, you will import and load cifar10.

```python
# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
cifar10 = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = cifar10.load_data()

# Define the class names for plotting
class_names = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer',
               'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']
```

Step 3: Explore the Data (CRITICAL STEP)

This is where you need to pay close attention. In the tutorial, the train_images had a shape of (60000, 28, 28). What is the shape of your new train_images?

- Find the `shape` of `train_images`.
- Find the `shape` of `train_labels`. Notice it's slightly different from Fashion MNIST's labels.
- Use `plt.imshow()` to look at the first image (`train_images[0]`). It will look colorful and pixelated.

Step 4: Preprocess the Data

This step is identical. The pixel values in CIFAR-10 also range from 0 to 255. You need to normalize them to a range of 0.0 to 1.0.

```python
# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0
```

Step 5: Build the Model (THE MAIN CHALLENGE)

Now, you will build the exact same model architecture as the tutorial:

- A `Flatten` layer first
- A `Dense` layer with 128 neurons and `relu` activation
- A `Dense` layer with 10 neurons (for the 10 classes)

**Your challenge:** The `Flatten` layer in the tutorial used `input_shape=(28, 28)`. This will *not* work for your new data. Using the shape you found in Step 3, what should the `input_shape` be for your CIFAR-10 data?

```
# Build the model, replacing ??? with the correct input shape
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(???)),  # <-- YOU MUST CHANGE THIS LINE
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
```

*Hint: A color image has three dimensions: (height, width, color_channels).*

Step 6: Compile the Model

This step is identical. The problem is still a multi-class classification, and the labels are integers (0-9), so the tutorial's optimizer and loss function are perfect.

Python

```
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Step 7: Train the Model

This is identical. Train the model for 10 epochs and observe the accuracy.

Python

```python
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)
```

*Note: Don't be surprised if the accuracy is much lower than for Fashion MNIST! CIFAR-10 is a harder dataset, and this simple model will struggle. Getting 45-55% accuracy is normal for this model.*

Step 8: Evaluate Accuracy

This is identical. See how your model performs on the test set.

```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)
print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)
```

Step 9: Make Predictions

This is identical. Create the probability model by adding a Softmax layer and then use it to make predictions.

```python
probability_model = tf.keras.Sequential([model, tf.keras.layers.Softmax()])
predictions = probability_model.predict(test_images)

# You can now try to plot the predictions, just like in the tutorial!
# Make sure to use your new `class_names` list.
```

### Bonus Challenge (Optional, XC)

The simple model from the tutorial performs poorly on CIFAR-10. Can you improve it?

Try modifying **Step 5 (Build the Model)**. After the `Dense(128, activation='relu')` layer, try adding **another** `Dense` layer (e.g., 64 neurons, also with `relu` activation) before the final `Dense(10)` layer.

Does this new, "deeper" model get better accuracy?
