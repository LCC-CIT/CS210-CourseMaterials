<h1>Lab 1, Python and AI Warm-Up</h1>

<h2>Group C</h2>

**CS 210, Intro to AI Programming**



### 1. Translate a Program into Python

#### PC Component Compatibility Checker

Create a system that checks the compatibility of two core PC components: the **CPU Socket Type** and the **RAM Type**. The system should output whether the components are **Compatible** or **Incompatible**.

| CPU Socket Type | Required RAM Type | Result if Correct RAM | Result if Incorrect RAM |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **LGA1700**     | DDR5              | Compatible            | Incompatible            |
| **AM4**         | DDR4              | Compatible            | Incompatible            |
| **Other**       | Any               | Incompatible          | Incompatible            |


Translate the program from either [JavaScript](pcComponentCompatibility.js) or [C#](pcComponentCompatibility.cs) into Python



### 2. Write a Python Program

#### Athlete Performance Rating

Design an expert system that assigns a performance *Rating* to an athlete based on their *Speed Score* (0-100) and *Strength Score* (0-100). The system must assign the highest applicable tier.

- **Elite:** Speed Score ≥90 **AND** Strength Score ≥80.
- **Advanced:** Speed Score ≥70 **OR** Strength Score ≥70.
- **Intermediate:** Speed Score ≥50.
- **Beginner:** All other scores.



## Submitting your lab work on Moodle

### Beta Version

- Post the beta version of both programs to your team channel in Discord.

### Code Review

- Review one of your lab partners' code and post the review in your team channel on Discord.
- Submit a copy of the code review <u>you did</u> on Moodle.

### Production Version

 Based on the code review and helpful advice from your lab partners, you may revise your code. On the code review from your lab partner, complete the “Prod.” column to show what you revised. Upload the following to the *Lab Production Version* assignment on Moodle:

1. The two Python (.py) files
3. The code review <u>from your lab partner</u> with the “Prod.” column filled out by you.

This will be a total of 3 files.

### Grading Criteria

The main focus of grading will be on correct coding and problem solving skills.
