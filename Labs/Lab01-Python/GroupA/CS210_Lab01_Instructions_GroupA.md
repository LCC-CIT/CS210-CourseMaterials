<h1>Lab 1, Python and AI Warm-Up</h1>

<h2>Group A</h2>

**CS 210, Intro to AI Programming**



### 1. Translate a Program into Python

#### Shipping Cost Calculator

This program calculates the shipping cost based on the package's *Weight (in kg)* and the *Destination Zone* (A, B, or C). The system must apply base costs and surcharges using the following tiered structure:

| Zone  | Weight ≤5 kg | 5< Weight ≤10 kg | Weight >10 kg |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| **A** | $10.00       | $15.00           | $20.00        |
| **B** | $15.00       | $20.00           | $25.00        |
| **C** | $20.00       | $25.00           | $30.00        |

Translate the program from either [JavaScript](shippingCalculator.js) or [C#](shippingCalculator.cs) into Python

### 2. Write a Python Program

**Financial Product Recommendation System**

Create a simplified expert system that recommends a suitable investment product based on two factors provided by the user: *Investment Horizon* (Short-Term: <5 years, or Long-Term: ≥5 years) and *Risk Tolerance* (Low or High).

| Horizon    | Risk Tolerance | Recommended Product         |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Short-Term | Low            | High-Yield Savings Account  |
| Short-Term | High           | Short-Term Corporate Bonds  |
| Long-Term  | Low            | Government Bonds/Index Fund |
| Long-Term  | High           | Diversified Stock Portfolio |

## Submitting your lab work on Moodle

### Beta Version

- Post the beta version of both programs to your team channel in Discord.

### Code Review

- Review one of your lab partners' code and post the review in your team channel on Discord.
- Submit a copy of the code review <u>you did</u> on Moodle.

### Production Version

 Based on the code review and helpful advice from your lab partners, you may revise your code. On the code review from your lab partner, complete the “Prod.” column to show what you revised. Upload the following to the *Lab Production Version* assignment on Moodle:

1. The two Python (.py) files
3. The code review <u>from your lab partner</u> with the “Prod.” column filled out by you.

This will be a total of 3 files.

### Grading Criteria

The main focus of grading will be on correct coding and problem solving skills.
